![Unicorn Rentals]({})

At Unicorn.Rentals, we hire dreamers who are willing to put in extra hours to take our offering of mythical creatures to the next level.

Now, Unicorn.Rentals needs to deliver its next generation, cloud hosted, hooftastic marketing website! As the core team responsible for the deployment and migration, 
you'll ship the features that power Unicorn.Rental's new website, and debug any problems that come up when the Unicorns break loose. 
Throughout this challenge you'll explore rolling out the new website, building feature flags, troubleshooting problems, and rolling out new capabilities... hopefully with no broken horns!

![Soon]({})

It's Day 1, your first build pipeline for the the new Unicorn.Rentals website is running currently. Roll up your sleeves, crack your knuckles, and get the application UP! 
Create a new AWS App Runner application using a container image of the brand new Marketing Website as follows:

## App Runner Configuration: 

1. **Container Image URL** - Browse for the `unicornrentalsapp` in the image list. If you do not see the image, wait for LaunchDarkly-app-pipeline CodePipeline to finish and refresh App Runner. 
2. **ECR Access Role** - Select **Create new service role**, use defaults.  
3. **Environment Variables** - Create one called `LD_SERVER_KEY` with the LD_SERVER_KEY listed above
4. **Port** - Set it to `5000`
5. **Security Tab > Instance role** - Set to `LDUnicornAppRunnerInstanceRole`

When you're done entering the configuration and the application starts deploying, enter the name of the application (**CASE SENSITIVE**) below to validate your configuration. 
Please note that you don't have to wait for the deployment to finish to provide your answer!

You created an App Runner deployment of the new marketing website, and the URL for the new page is, or will shortly be, functional (within 5-10 minutes). You are one step closer to having the site live and serving user traffic! 

Now we're going to use LaunchDarkly to manage our feature releases separate from the deployment using [Feature Flags](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/what-are-feature-flags/).

You just received a notification from the web development team that the new version of the Unicorn.Rentals website is ready for user testing! 

The developers included a **[feature flag](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/what-are-feature-flags/)** in the new code that toggles the visibility of the new website. 
Now you have to create a corresponding flag in [LaunchDarkly](https://app.launchdarkly.com) that allows your OPS team to switch the website to the newly released version. Here are your tasks: 

1. Check the [application code](https://github.com/codyde/ld-aws-gameday/blob/db49c4be0791e2cb0a46c7d0f803ac078067644a/pages/index.js#L58) and locate the info of the new website's release flag.
2. Use this information to create a corresponding feature flag in LaunchDarkly.
3. Enable the flag in LaunchDarkly by toggling Targeting to ON.

Once your site release flag is enabled in LaunchDarkly, you should see the new site in your App Runner's URL!

![Debug Data]({})

Your team notices significant amounts of debug data on the newly released Unicorn.Rentals site. We could just turn off the flag and take the site down, but fortunately we have a better option.

During development, the team added enhanced logging behind a feature flag, which will only be available to specific users. This can be quite handy for isolating problems. 
For this task, we'll create a feature flag in LaunchDarkly and configure it so that only user `debuguser` sees the log messages. For this task you'll need to:

1. Check the application code to find the feature flag configuration. You can use the [client-side code](https://github.com/codyde/ld-aws-gameday/blob/a383dbf064d081b841937b27b637519243726470/pages/index.js#L78) or the [server-side code](https://github.com/codyde/ld-aws-gameday/blob/6cfe5fc27d2d1a05d99cf815563ace17b504f2b1/main.py#L195) for this information. 
2. In LaunchDarkly, create a [multi-variate feature flag](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/variations) that matches the flag described in the code. 
3. Create a [targeting rule](https://docs.launchdarkly.com/home/flags/targeting-users) that serves the `debug` feature for `debuguser` and serves the `default` rule to everyone else. (**Hint:** make sure you specify that only the `debuguser` sees the `debug` feature by default!) 

Once enabled, login as `debuguser` to view the administrative menu, you can enter the value from this UI menu or visit the `/teamdebug` route. Enter the `debugcode` value in the input below.

Upon enabling the debug menu you have found that the application is still connecting to its local debug data. This data was left in place from previous development iterations and was meant to be swapped out!

The connectivity code for the database has a feature flag controlling it. We can use feature flags to rollout our database! Onto Task 4!

# TASK 4 - Final question
TASK4_KEY="task4"

TASK4_VALUE="""
From our last task, we learned that we are using local debug data instead of the database in AWS. Fortunately, we can use a feature flag to [roll out the database change](https://launchdarkly.com/blog/database-migration-using-launchdarkly/) to the Unicorn.Rentals environment. 

Just like before, the development team has already staged our code for the database migration. To complete this task you must do the following: 

1. Check the [application code](https://github.com/codyde/ld-aws-gameday/blob/6cfe5fc27d2d1a05d99cf815563ace17b504f2b1/main.py#L128) and retrieve the flag information. 
2. Create a feature flag in LaunchDarkly to enable the database change.

Your migration is successful, you are now returning data to the Unicorn.Rentals UI from AWS DynamoDB!

If we had discovered a problem with the database connection - we can disable the feature and return it back to the original code in milliseconds (the "kill switch").

All in a days work for a Unicorn Admin!
